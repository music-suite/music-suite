-- Here 'delay' and 'stretch' are used to adjust phase and frequency
-- of a sine.
--
-- Note that numeric operators are defined pointwise on behaviors.
-- The primitive 'sine' function has amplitude 1, so (sine * n) has
-- amplitude n.
--
-- A 'Score ()' is used to determine the onset and offset of each
-- note (e.g. where to sample the Behavior). Note that behaviors
-- are defined for the entire time domain (they extend "infinitely"
-- in both directions), so we can sample them at any point.
