Start with
  - A basic harmonic material (a couple of pitch classes)
  - A time-varying ambitus (or a linear function from Time to Ambitus)

How to convert an ambitus (i.e. a pitch range) into an actual chord (a list of pitches).
Depends on some kind of "harmonic space".

Classically, this would be a set of PCs. A (finite) PC set can be seen as an infinite collection
of pitches (modolo octaves). For example the triad {c,e,g} is a space that, when queried in the
ambitus (c..e') gives [c,e,g,c',e'].

Here, we define a more general notation: a pitch space can be created from any infinite interval
sequence and is laid out from a central origin. For a triad, we start with m3,_M3,_P4 (_P1 is
included by default). The interval list is repeated indefinately in both directions, so its
sum becomes the repetitivity (term?) of the space. For a triad the sum is _P8, so a triad
is an octave-repeating pitch space, as expected.

>>> sumV [m3,_M3,_P4::Interval]
_P8

-- Major triad:
>>> lookupSpace ((g_,e')^.ambitus) (symmetricPitchSpace c [m3,_M3,_P4])
[g_,c,eb,g,c',eb']

-- Octotonic scale:
>>> lookupSpace ((g_,e')^.ambitus) (symmetricPitchSpace c [_M2,m2])
[gs_,a_,b_,c,d,eb,f,gb,ab,bbb,cb',dbb',ebb']

-}


space1, space2 :: PitchSpace
space1 = symmetricPitchSpace c [m3,_M3,_P4]
space2 = symmetricPitchSpace d [m3,_M2,m3,_M3]

{-
For each ambitus, look up up a harmonic pattern, and get the current pitches.
Always return 12 pitches, repeating if necessary.

{-
The pitchSpaceVoices' example above contains a harmonic material for a piece.
It contains pitch and register material, as well as durations of the harmonic blocks.

The next step would be to orchestrate a single harmonic block.
Given just the pitch material and the duration of the whole block (multiples of 1 in this
example), we must decide on:
  - Which instrument is playing which part of the pitch set
  - Is each instrument playing just a single sustained pitch, or something else?
    What are the alternatives?
      - Play something repeatedly
        - With separation!
      - Play a chord (piano/strings/harp)
      - Play a pattern alternating between 2 or more pitches
        - Arp up/down, alberti bass etc
      - Counterpointal techniques:
        - Play an appogiatura figure to a chord-note (very classical!)
        - Play 2 or more pitches and leading notes in-between

Something like
-}
data Texture
  = Sustained Int -- Number of pitches to sustain, consumes that number of pitches
  | Separate Duration Texture -- Forces wrapped texture to be separated (if it contains repetition or sequencing)
  | Sequence Texture Texture
  | Repeat Texture -- Repeat forever
  deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

renderTexture :: Duration -> [Pitch] -> Texture
renderTexture = undefined

texturize :: Note [Pitch] -> Score Pitch
texturize = undefined


{-
Ideas:
  WW sustained notes
  WW each plauyer alternating 2 notes (Petroushka opening!)
    This can be in contrary motion
  WW each player alternating 3 notes phased (Holst beg. of Jupiter, end of saturn)
  Brass fanfares (classical!)
  Horns sustained tone
  Flugelhorn tremolo
  Marimba/Xyl tremolo 1 note
  Piano hand tremolo (1 chord in each hand, usually 16ths)
  Strings, 1-string tremolo (weird!)
  Strings, 2-string tremolo
  Strings, arpeggio (Wagner, viola!)
  Cello arpeggio + leadings notes (classical?)
  Woodwind (esp flutes) double tounging, 2 or more pitches (usually 16 or 32ths) (c c e e c c e e)
  Strings, harmonics
  Woodwinds playing rhythmizied arpeggio, chorally (Holst, end of Saturn)

  Tutti long notes fff
  Strings divisi
  Chords slowly repeated with syncopation


The possibilities here are really endless, so let's just start with some basics.

  How? How? How?
    It is obviously easy to write a function
      :: Note [Pitch] -> Score (Part, Articulation, Dynamics, Pitch)
    or equivalently
      :: Note [Pitch] -> Score StandardNote
    Then we can go
      Voice [Pitch] ==> [Note Pitch] ==> [Score StandardNote] ==> Score StandardNote

    The problem is that all the techniques above are quite different? How do we make
    a good *local* decision on how to orchestrate a (Note [Pitch])? We should think
    about
      - Harmony: How do we handle the amount of consoncance/dissoncance? For example given
        a bitonal chord {c e g fs as cs} there is quite a difference to do (flutes: c e g, horns: fs as cs)
        vs (muted trumpets: c f, violin col legno: e as, trombones: g cs). The latter brings out the
        dissonance while the former obscures it.

      - Sustain: What are the sustain characteristic of the chord?

      - Dynamics: What is the level of dynamics?

      - Movement: What kind of movement do we have in the orchestral texture

      - Blend: Does the instrument combinations match or not and what is the implication of that?

      - Doubling: Is the sound "thin" or fat?

    Think about:
      WBs general notations of a good mix:
        Separation in time, space and register! (I'd say also in timbre!)
        Possibly worth looking into the French school here

      Solo vs. tutti!

      Form! Rate of change

      JAs Thoughts of phrasing and breath!

    In short, I think the
      :: Note [Pitch] -> Score StandardNote
    solution is too general! Can we restrict it somehow? As in
      :: Orchestration -> Note [Pitch] -> Score StandardNote
    Or even just define a discrete set of (Note [Pitch] -> Score StandardNote) and interpolate, i.e.
      :: [(OrchestrationProperties, Note [Pitch] -> Score StandardNote)]
    so it becoms a discrete function/database?
