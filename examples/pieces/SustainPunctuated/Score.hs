{-
Main idea: Given a melody, decorate it by artificially sustaining certain notes.

NOTE This (trivial, unclean) example could become the basis for a whole piece.
I.e. start out with a Cantus Firmus, sustain certain pitches, these become chords/sounds to which melodic motion is added
and so on.

The fast notes (subj, subj2) are generated using stitchTogether, which unfolds a melody
by stitching it with itself.

TODO the uses of stretchRelativeOnset is unnecessary for now. If the sustained notes are
not in some non-decaying instrument (e.g. not metal percussion) it might be useful to set
durations explicitly.
