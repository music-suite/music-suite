-- The 'import' statement allow us to use Music Suite in this Haskell file.

-- | Here we define a simple piece of music.
--
-- The first line "music :: Music" is a type hint, saying that 'music'
-- is a piece of music.
--
-- The notes c, d and e are composed sequentially using the operator |>.
--
-- The stretch operator |* is used to stretch all of the notes to 1/4
-- (e.g. crotchets/quarter notes).
--
-- The 'times' function repeats the 3-note figure 5 times.
music :: Music
music = times 4 $ (c |> d |> e) |* (1/4)

-- This line creates a standard Haskell main function that exports the piece
-- 'music'. This means we can run this file as a standard Haskell program,
-- or even compile it into a standalone program.
