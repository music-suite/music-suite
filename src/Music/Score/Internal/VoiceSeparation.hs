      We are looking for a partition of the set of notes *in each bar/staff* such that
        (voice sep should be post tie split, post chord merge, pre quantization, i.e. as late as possible,
         as complexity grows so quickly!)
      - Each subset is a voice (no overlapping notes)
      - The number of subsets (size of the partition) is as small as possible
      - The sum of all adjacent steps in each subvoice (its cumulative step size) is as small as possible
      - The ambitus of each subvoice (max pitch-min pitch) is as small as possible
    The number of partitions to consider grows quickly, so we really need a heuristic method
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number
    Type (Score a -> [NooverlapScore a]) or (Score a -> [Voice (Maybe a)])

{-
Returns a set partition of the the given values.

- The first function provides a way to reject a partition as invalid.
- The first function provides a way to to weight partitions.

A partition with relatively high weight *should* be returned (no guarantees here).

{-
This is probably to general.

It is essentially brute-force at is has to generate all partitions
(using setPartitionsWithKParts or similar), and then filter.

Yes we have lazy evalutation, but look at the numbers below.

    partitionWeighted :: Set a -> (Set a -> Bool) -> (Set a -> Double) -> Set (Set a)

{-
When applied to (bar/part-wise) voice sep, k will almost always be in [1..4].

Possibly good strategy
  If k and m are small, use setPartitionsWithKParts/partitionWeighted.

-- Partition a set such that each subset matches the predicate.

-- Simplistic implementation:
--   - Pick elements from unchosen elements such that the predicate matches
--   - If we can not pick anymore elements, proceed to next subset
--
-- Fast, but unweighted (in terms of voice sep: may generate strange partitions).
-- Essentially:
--
--   * Remove elements from a set S until it passes the predicate, this becomes a subset.
--
--   * Repeat until no elements left.
