# music-pitch

This package provides various representations of musical pitch.

Note that this package is independent of `music-score` and vice versa. This is a deliberate design choice: the user should be free to combine any pitch representation with any time structure. Normally you will include both packages through `music-preludes`.

This library is part of the Music Suite, see <http://musicsuite.github.com>.
